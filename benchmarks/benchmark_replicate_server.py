ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released on November 30, 2022. It uses large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o along with other multimodal models to generate human-like responses in text, speech, and images.[3][4] It has access to features such as searching the web, using apps, and running programs.[5][6] It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period of rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[7] Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[8][9]

ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[8] Successive user prompts and replies are considered as context at each stage of the conversation.[10] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o but at a reduced limit. The ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Pro", "Team", and "Enterprise" provide increased usage limits and access to additional features or models.[11] Users on the Pro plan have unlimited usage, except for abuse guardrails.

By January 2023, ChatGPT had become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[12][13] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok.[14] Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In May 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced, in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems.[15] As of May 2025, ChatGPT's website is among the 5 most-visited websites globally.[16][17]

ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released on November 30, 2022. It uses large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o along with other multimodal models to generate human-like responses in text, speech, and images.[3][4] It has access to features such as searching the web, using apps, and running programs.[5][6] It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period of rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[7] Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[8][9]

ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[8] Successive user prompts and replies are considered as context at each stage of the conversation.[10] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o but at a reduced limit. The ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Pro", "Team", and "Enterprise" provide increased usage limits and access to additional features or models.[11] Users on the Pro plan have unlimited usage, except for abuse guardrails.

ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[8] Successive user prompts and replies are considered as context at each stage of the conversation.[10] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o but at a reduced limit. The ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Pro", "Team", and "Enterprise" provide increased usage limits and access to additional features or models.[11] Users on the Pro plan have unlimited usage, except for abuse guardrails.

By January 2023, ChatGPT had become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[12][13] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok.[14] Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In May 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced, in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems.[15] As of May 2025, ChatGPT's website is among the 5 most-visited websites globally.[16][17]

ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released on November 30, 2022. It uses large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o along with other multimodal models to generate human-like responses in text, speech, and images.[3][4] It has access to features such as searching the web, using apps, and running programs.[5][6] It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period of rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[7] Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[8][9]

ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[8] Successive user prompts and replies are considered as context at each stage of the conversation.[10] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o but at a reduced limit. The ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Pro", "Team", and "Enterprise" provide increased usage limits and access to additional features or models.[11] Users on the Pro plan have unlimited usage, except for abuse guardrails.

By January 2023, ChatGPT had become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[12][13] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok.[14] Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In May 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced, in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems.[15] As of May 2025, ChatGPT's website is among the 5 most-visited websites globally.[16][17]

ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released on November 30, 2022. It uses large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o along with other multimodal models to generate human-like responses in text, speech, and images.[3][4] It has access to features such as searching the web, using apps, and running programs.[5][6] It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period of rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[7] Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[8][9]

ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[8] Successive user prompts and replies are considered as context at each stage of the conversation.[10] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o but at a reduced limit. The ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Pro", "Team", and "Enterprise" provide increased usage limits and access to additional features or models.[11] Users on the Pro plan have unlimited usage, except for abuse guardrails.

By January 2023, ChatGPT had become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[12][13] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok.[14] Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4.

ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[8] Successive user prompts and replies are considered as context at each stage of the conversation.[10] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o but at a reduced limit. The ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Pro", "Team", and "Enterprise" provide increased usage limits and access to additional features or models.[11] Users on the Pro plan have unlimited usage, except for abuse guardrails.

By January 2023, ChatGPT had become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[12][13] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok.[14] Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In May 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced, in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems.[15] As of May 2025, ChatGPT's website is among the 5 most-visited websites globally.[16][17]
